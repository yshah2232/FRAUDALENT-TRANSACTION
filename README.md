# FRAUDALENT-TRANSACTION
R - UNSUPERVISED, SUPERVISED, SEMI-SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES

‘‘Worldwide losses from card fraud rose to $21 billion in 2015, up from about $8 billion in 2010. By 2020, that number is expected to reach $31 billion

Problem:
Fraud transaction are a headache for the banks, insurance people and the stores

Reason:
Every year out of 12 billion transactions nearly 10 million transactions are fraud
Fraud in USA for year 2008 was estimated at 500 million$ 

GOAL
Using various data mining techniques we can detect the fraud transaction. Which may be helpful in reducing them 

Dataset:
We have  around 401,000 records reported by some salesperson each dateset includes 

ID
PROD
QUAT
VAL
INSP

PROBLEM FACED

UNKOWN VALUES
We start by addressing the problem of unknown variable values. there are essentially three alternatives: (1) remove the cases
(2) fill in the unknowns using some strategy,
(3) use tools that handle these types of values.  


FEW TRANSACTONS
There are products with very few transactions. This is a problem because we need to use the information on these transactions to decide if any of them are unusual.   

DATA MINING TECHNIQUES

Using data mining to provide guidance in the task of deciding which transaction reports should be considered for inspection as a result of strong suspicion of being fraudulent.. 

Unsupervised technique

Box plot rule
LOF(local outlier factor)
Cluster based ranking


Supervised technique

Class imbalance problems
Naïve Bayes
Ada boost.


Semi supervised technique


conclusion
We have seen that these three techniques(unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised)  can tackle this problem from different perspectives with a limited amount of resources

Several real-world applications map into this general framework

So we can use this techniques for, such as detecting frauds in credit card transactions, telecommunications, tax declarations.

Using these techniques we can easily identify the fraud transactions which will in return be helpful for us in saving the money.
